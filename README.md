# StarbucksPartnerTips
An open source, independantly developed application to facilitate doing the weekly tips. 
The dollar per hour amount for tips needs to be worked out by hand, but after that, each partner can be entered individually 
by name (unique), tippable hours, and the dollar per hour tip amount. After selecting the 'add' button, the partner and 
information will be added to a list of partners and then the partner's tips will be calculated. You can use to the selection 
spinner at the top to select partners who have already been entered, however, there currently isn't any functionality to 
update a partner's information-- so if you make a mistake or want to reuse the app on a weekly basis, you'll need to remove the 
partner and start over.
